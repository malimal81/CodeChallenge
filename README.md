CSVParser is the main class, and it takes 2 or three arguments. The first argument is the full file path of the csv file.

The second argument is a number that selects which calculation to perform:

 1. Total Salary
 2 .Total Salary by Role
 3. Total Salary by Time
 4. Total Salary by Role and Time
 5. Maximum Group
 
If 5 is selected as the second argument, a third argument is expected (Maximum Salary).
